IN INITIAL PHASE WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING RESOURCE: - 

XSD in French schema 

we were having a PDF consisting of sample output in the form of screenshots, due to which we were not able to copy that XML schema from the PDF for R&D perspective. 

And the TDM 

ISSUES: -  

The conversion of the French tag to English in which we approached Lisa and Leon they helped to provide the converted schema but due to the conversion we have many syntaxes issue in that particular schema and so we have to change the French name to English in the original source scheme only. 

After getting the proper schema we need to understand the flow of this schema to map the elements in IICS we connected to business to set up the call for solving queries and understand the flow of their schema but they refuse to connect over call and asked to discuss over the mail which was not much useful and after that we raised the ticket to DBIT then informatica person change the schema but the change in schema which happened is not aligned with the business requirements as they changed mandatory fields to the non-mandatory ones. 

Then we had discussion with Ming who explains schema and suggested to map all mandatory fields and this explanation of flow help us to generate hierarchy of XML and IICS. 

 

ISSUES IN THE FIELDS: - 

ADDRESS VERIFIER: - 

We don't have exact field which has to be mapped in the address so we are attaching the R&D file for the address verifier fields that were available in IICS and want to know the fields that we can map for the final output in IICS.  

Refer to this File:-  xml_Address_field_mapping.xlsx
